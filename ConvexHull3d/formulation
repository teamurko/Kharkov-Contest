Given a set of points by its coordinates x, y, z.
All points are different.
No three points are on the same line.
No four points are on the same plane.

Find a convex hull of this points.

Number of points is n (1 <= n <= 100000).

All points are numerated according to the order in input.
Coordinates of ith point is given in the (i+1)th line of input.

The convex hull is determined by its facets.

Print to output M number of facets to the first line.
Then print information about facets to the next M lines.
Each line should contain number of vertices in the facet
and indices of vertices in counter-clockwise order.
